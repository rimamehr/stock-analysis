# Analyzing all stock returns

## Overview of Project/Purpose
Steve wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in his dataset to help his parents make a sound decision on which is a good stock to invest. We originally helped write a code to go through all the ticker values to find the total volume and return on each stock but our code was not running efficiently enough. We then refactored the code to improve efficency and provided Steve with a VBA script that can later be used on a larger dataset as well.


## Results
The yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In our images below we can see that the same set of 12 stocks performed considerablaly better in 2017 in comparison to 2018. In 2017 only one stock (TERP) had a negative yearly return and rest all of the stocks performed really well. When we compare that to our stock performace in 2018, they all faired quite poorly with exception of 2 stocks (ENPH, RUN). These results help steve recomend some better stock choices for his parents to invest in. 

We have also provided below a snapshot of the time it took our code to run. These run times were after we refactored our VBA code for efficiency so that if Steve wants to run this analysis for a largest dataset he can do so quite effectively.
