# Analyzing all stock returns

## Overview of Project/Purpose
Steve wants to find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in his dataset to help his parents make a sound decision on which is a good stock to invest. We originally helped write a code to go through all the ticker values to find the total volume and return on each stock but our code was not running efficiently enough. We then refactored the code to improve efficency and provided Steve with a VBA script that can later be used on a larger dataset as well.
